#**Dot Pen**


An open-source **Note-taking app** that knows how to **count** stuff as well. 

**Clean** and completely **minimalistic**, it gets out of the way to help you keep those thoughts flowing while it takes care of storing them.

It comes with a built-in **counter** for each note to keep track of stuff.

----------

**Features**

 - Minimalist design - get your job done
 - Make a list of stuff to-do
 - Basic note-taking ability (using SQLite database)
	 - Take a quick note - use the 'plus' icon
	 - Write an elaborate note - use the 'dot pen' icon
 - Count the stuff - use the 'click' icon in the note page
	 - or simply edit the counter directly below
 - Delete notes from the main list - long press

**Have an idea?**

Tell me. Or better yet, fork it and implement it. Bring it back and I'll update the project.

Don't want to share? That's all right, you can use this project for your own applications. A little credit would be appreciated though.
